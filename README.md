[![Streamlink Twitch GUI][Preview]][Releases]


## Livestreamer Twitch GUI has been renamed

*Streamlink Twitch GUI*, previously known as *Livestreamer Twitch GUI*, has been renamed in early december 2016. A comment regarding this change can be found in the thread ["The future of Livestreamer Twitch GUI"][Application-rename].


## Description

A graphical user interface on top of the [Streamlink][Streamlink] command line interface.  

Streamlink Twitch GUI is a [NW.js][NW.js] application, which means that it is a web application written in JavaScript ([EmberJS][EmberJS]), HTML ([Handlebars][Handlebars]) and CSS ([LessCSS][LessCSS]) and is being run by a [Node.js][Node.js] powered version of [Chromium][Chromium].

## Why

One of the reasons for having bad viewing experiences on [Twitch.tv][Twitch] is the implementation of their resource-heavy website and HTML5 video player. Especially on mobile desktop devices, high CPU and memory usage and lack of GPU acceleration of the web browser can cause major issues like buffering, stuttering or low video playback frame rates, all while draining the device's battery and spinning up its fans. Even on desktop computers, watching streams on Twitch.tv while multi-tasking can be an issue.

With Streamlink Twitch GUI, you're not dependent on your web browser and streams can be watched in the video player of your choice, enabling a smooth video playback. Depending on your choice of player, additional features become available, like for example timeshift support or resolution/framerate upscaling. In addition to that, Streamlink's variable stream buffers will help you countering bad network conditions or reducing the stream's latency even further.

Please bear in mind that you're bypassing any ads run by Twitch by using this software. If you want to support [Twitch][Twitch] or a single broadcaster, please consider buying [Twitch Prime][TwitchPrime] or subscribing to the broadcaster's channel. Thank you!


## Download

### Stable release

[**Visit the project's wiki**][Wiki] for detailed installation and configuration guides, or just see the [GitHub releases][Releases] page if you don't need help. The wiki also includes a list of supported packages for your platform.

Please remember that **Streamlink Twitch GUI**, as the name already suggests, is only a graphical user interface (GUI) built on top of the **Streamlink** command line interface (CLI). This means that [Streamlink][Streamlink] has to be installed on your system in order to be able to launch streams. Once again, see the [wiki][Wiki] if you need help, as it also covers installing Streamlink.
