[Changelog](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink-twitch-gui/compare/v1.9.0...v1.9.1)


## [v1.9.0](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink-twitch-gui/releases/tag/v1.9.0) (2019-11-23)

This release mainly focuses on fixing the recent issues related to the [breaking changes of Twitch's API](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/issues/2680). Since the situation wasn't 100% clear for the first couple of days, we had to wait until we were able to make a proper decision.

For Streamlink Twitch GUI, this means that a couple of features had to be removed, unfortunately. If Twitch decides to make the API endpoints available to third party app developers which were required by the removed features, I will be more than happy to re-implement them.

Support for Livestreamer has also finally been removed. If you were still using Livestreamer, you will have to [install and use Streamlink now](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink-twitch-gui/wiki/Installation).

- :warning: Set Streamlink's version requirement to `1.3.0`.  
  Upgrade to the latest Streamlink version [here](https://streamlink.github.io/install.html) or see the [wiki](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink-twitch-gui/wiki).
- Removed everything that was using Twitch's old private API. #684
  - Removed channel panels.
  - Removed subscriptions list.
  - Removed hosted streams list.
  - Removed followed games list and (un)follow game button.
- Removed deprecated Livestreamer support. #667
- Removed login sharing with Streamlink. #682
- Added back automatic theme selection. #666
- Added more fallback paths for VLC and MPV on macOS. #664
- Added media title parameter to MPV player preset. #683
- Upgraded NW.js to 0.42.3 (Chromium 78.0.3904.97 / NodeJS 13.1.0).
- Updated donation links and texts.


[Changelog](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink-twitch-gui/compare/v1.8.1...v1.9.0)


## [v1.8.1](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink-twitch-gui/releases/tag/v1.8.1) (2019-08-09)

This is a critical bugfix release for the crashing Windows builds since v1.8.0 which downgrades the used NW.js version. See #656 for more information.

If you've already upgraded to v1.8.0, regardless the OS, you may see an NW.js downgrade error message (once) in the future. This can be ignored. Deleting the user-data-dir, which will wipe your settings and login, before upgrading to v1.8.1 and downgrading NW.js is also an option.

If you're coming from v1.7.1, you can ignore all of this.

Once again, I apologize for the inconveniences.

Please see the full changelog of the [v1.8.0](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink-twitch-gui/releases/tag/v1.8.0) release!

- Downgraded NW.js to 0.39.3 (Chromium 75.0.3770.142 / Node 12.6.0).

Since September 15th, all anonymous Twitch API requests will now be rejected. This has been announced several weeks ago and the Livestreamer Twitch GUI was upgraded in the `v0.14.0` release. Unfortunately, Livestreamer did not receive any upgrades due to the inactivity of its maintainer and it is unknown if there will be any upgrades at all in the future.
The only workaround for this missing change is forcing all users to log in and let Livestreamer use their Twitch OAuth token. Livestreamer Twitch GUI has always passed the user's login data to Livestreamer, which means that you're fine unless you did not log in to you Twitch account in the GUI. See #310 for more information.

Please also see #289 if you think you can help with the organization of a Livestreamer fork. There are several bugs that need to be fixed and some features/ideas that need to be implemented for a better experience. This will benefit all Livestreamer and Livestreamer Twitch GUI users, thank you!

  Twitch had changed their API lately, so livestreamer was unable to launch any streams.

## [v0.2.1](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink-twitch-gui/releases/tag/v0.2.1) (2013-12-30)

Just a patch release, no new features.

[Changelog](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink-twitch-gui/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1)


## [v0.2.0](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink-twitch-gui/releases/tag/v0.2.0) (2013-12-21)

In this release I've added the settings menu so you can now set the path to where you've installed livestreamer to. You can also change the default stream quality.
There is currently no validation of the user input and some more fields for customizing the videoplayer are disabled for now. I'm planning to add those things (and also the ability to choose the quality by each stream individually) in the next releases, but thats it for now.

[Changelog](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink-twitch-gui/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0)


## [v0.1.0](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink-twitch-gui/releases/tag/v0.1.0) (2013-12-13)

There is not much to see, just some core functionality and some design ideas.

The only thing you can do right now is browsing the top games, top channels by game and all top channels. A click on a channel will then start a new livestreamer process with the stream quality preset "best". Please make sure that livestreamer is defined in your PATH-variable. There will be no output of this child process, so please be patient and wait for your videoplayer to start.
